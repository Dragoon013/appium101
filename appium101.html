                    <p>So before we go into the different parts we need to incldue in a script, let's talk about our training environment.</p>
                    <p>First off, we'll be working in a VM provided by ReadyTech today. If you have any problems during the course of labs, I will be able to go into your instance and help you out. You can just notify me using the ReadyTech instance to tell me that you need help.</p>
                    <p>We're also going to be working in Eclipse today. In Eclipse, we have set up the scripts within a framework called TestNG, for Java, that allows us to run the scripts with all of the dependencies it needs very easily.</p>
                    <p>That within that framework, there is a library, or build tool, called Maven that we are using to grab our dependencies, bundle them together, and then run our script.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the course today, the way we will run our tests is by using the "Maven test" command, which should compile all of our resources and dependencies together, and run it for us.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, for those of you who may not have used Eclipse before, when you type in a line that does not have the right syntax, it will generally underline the offending line or part of the line that you need to fix, in red. If you simply hover or select that part of the line, Ecplise will give you suggestions on how to fix the problem.</p>

				  <h3>What is Sauce Labs?</h3>
                  <p>Testing infrastructure in the cloud for web and mobile web applications.</p>

                    <p>So what is this Sauce Labs? They describe themselves as providers and supporters of Web Automated and Mobile Automated testing.</p>
                    <p>They support two very large open source projects, namely Selenium and Appium. Selenium is used for Desktop and mobile browser testing, while appium is used for native and hybrid application testing.</p>
                    <p>Sauce Labs provides environments that run your Selenium or Appium tests on any browser and OS combination you like - and they have over 500 combinations thereof. (if you include the different browser versions)</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                         Sauce Labs was founded in 2008 by Jason Huggins, co-creator of Selenium (the open source standard for automated testing frameworks) and Steve Hazel, current CTO. They set out to create a cloud-based platform for automated testing to free development teams from the hassle and cost of testing so they can focus on innovating their core capabilities.
                      </p>
                      <p>In an interview, Jason said the inspiration for starting Sauce labs came when he was working as a QA consultant. He was using Selenium to do browser testing, and the process of testing the apps in different browsers was taking too long. The problem was that all the testing was being done on one machine, so he split the tests onto 4 different machines, effectively running the tests in parallel, which cut the time drastically. Which is precisely what Sauce Labs does today.</p>

					<h3>CI/CD Cycle</h3>

                    <img src="assets/images/sauceCI2.png" style="border:0; text-align:center; background:none;">
                    <p style="text-align:center;">Continuous Integration/Continuous Development</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                      <p>Sauce Labs' value as a time saver is apparent even in its role in Continuous Integration and Delivery. </p>
                      <p>Traditionally, testing and QA are bottlenecks for application delivery and release. Writing automated tests, maintaining testing infrastructure, painful manual testing, all consume huge amounts of time. The work is never done either, because the product is always changing.</p>
                      <p>Sauce Labs takes away those worries though. With Selenium and Appium testing, we remove the barrier of time consuming test writing, and with Sauce Labs itself, we remove the need to have a propietary infrastructure. Sauce Labs provides the infrastructure for you, allowing you to test on a variety of platforms in a speedy manner. So you can focus on development, and releases,and leave the testing to Sauce Labs.</p>
                      <p>Sauce Labs reduces the pain of testing, so that instead of traditionally waiting until the end of the development life cycle to test, you can test iteratively, as you go through each step of development.</p>

				  <h3>What is Appium?</h3>
                  <p>Developed in 2011 by Dan Cuellar, the Test Manager at Zoosk.</p>
				  <p>Uses UIAutomation Framework to run in real time like an interpreter.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Simulate mobile gestures</li>
                    <li>Automate Mobile Application Testing</li>
                  </ul>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>History: Was developed in 2011 when Dan Cuellar wasn't satisfied with the current landscape of mobile testing tools. Dan came up with the idea of running Apple's UIAutomation framework as a real time interperter and used Apple utilities to execute shell commands, ordered text files to recieve commands, evalutate the output, execute said commands, and write them to disc using Python.</p>
                    <p>Then he created a C# version of the program, which mimicked Selenium-style syntax to sequentially order javascript commands and the first iteration of Appium was born.</p>
                    <p>Dan then presented his project at the Selenium Conference in 2012 and caught the attention of Jason Huggins. Jason and Dan workded together to release the source code and then present the project at the Mobile Testing Summit of 2013. Not long after, Sauce Lab fully backed Dan's project, changed the name to Appium and the rest is history.</p>

				  <h3>Local vs. Remote Appium Tests</h3>

                  <div style="float:left;width:50%;" class="centered">
                    <p>Local:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Requires Appium Server</li>
                        <li>iOS development requires Xcode tools</li>
                        <li>Need all the libraries and images to run device simulators/emulators</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                  <div style="float:right;width:50%;padding-right:0px;">
                    <p>Remote:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Appium server is remote</li>
                      <li>Device images and virtualization</li>
                      <li>Parallelization</li>
                      <li>Record Results</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>For iOS mobile testing, the Appium server converts the WebDriver commands from your test script into the UIAutomation JavaScript commands that can be understood by Apple Instruments. These commands are then sent to your iOS mobile application and execute those commands against the application in the simulator or device.</p>
                    <p>Android Appium tests require the Appium Server to convert the test script JSON into UIAutomator Java commands, parse the data when testing it against your mobile emulator of your choice, then convert the response back to JSON, and relay the JSON data to the appium script</p>
                    <p>But that's pretty painful and time consuming to set up and manage all on your own.</p>
                    <p>Sauce Labs handles all of that stuff for you. They essentially run an Appium Server themselves, provide integration for multiple mobile frameworks, and rent it out to their customers to run their Appium tests on. </p>

                    <p>If tbe hosting Mobile Application testing infrastructure itself isn't enough, Sauce Labs provides a whole slew of other additional features, such as security, recorded tests and integration with other tools. Sauce Labs provides security through it's Sauce Connect technology, which allows you to run tests on your locally hosted application. It sends your Selenium or appium commands through an encrypted tunnel, ensuring that your information is protected.</p>
                    <p>Seamless integration refers the multitude of pltforms that Sauce integrates with, such as Jenkins, Bamboo, JIRA, and more.</p>
                    <p>And each test you run is recorded by default. This includes screenshots, a video recording of the entire test, as well as log files.</p>

                    <li>Dashboard: On the dashboard, there are 3 different tabs. These help organize the kinds of tests that we run on Sauce Labs.</li>
                    <p>We have a tab for tests that are run and labelled as builds, one for our automated tests, and one for manual tests.</p>
                    <li>Tunnels: The tunnels tab will list out all of secure tunnels that are currently enabled and running between Sauce Labs and your local machine.</li>
                    <li>Account Details: Lastly, our account details page is important. You can see your VM usage, as well as find your access key, which is required for authentication when using Sauce Labs. We'll go into how to use it later on.</li>

                  <h3>Manual Testing</h3>
                  <p>The traditional method of testing applications and sites.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Testing Locally</li>
                    <li>Sauce Labs Manual Tests</li>
                  </ul>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Traditionally, once your app was ready to be tested, you would load it onto a physical device, and then test it with your own fingers. There are a few problems with that, namely, it takes a lot of time to do and you're limited to the devices you have. So then you can run your test manually on an emulator or simulator to take care of the device problem. But the issue of time, of someone physically clicking on the device emulator or phyiscally touching the device is a huge time suck.</p>
                    <p>With sauce labs, you can run manual tests without having to set up the infrastructure locally. This can help you with memory issues you may run into running simulators and emulators on your own local machine, and can give you a good way test out the app on more devices than you could easily do locally.</p>

                   <p>Appium has a client/server architecture. In order to send commands to the local or remote appium server which will pass those along to a device, we need the Appium client.</p>
                    <p>The appium client is simply a library that you can use to write Appium test scripts in your favorite language. These client libraries are extensions of the Selenium WebDriver client, so they should all the same functionality, as well as syntax.</p>
                    <p>The Appium server is a Node.js webserver, that has an exposed REST API. It connects with the client, accepts commands, executes those commands on a mobile device, and then passes the results of those commands back in an HTTP response. The client/server architecture gives us a lot of freedom. IT allows us to run the the server on a different machines than where we run our tests. This also allows Sauce Labs to run tests for you on their cloud service.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>The Appium GUI is wrapped around an appium server, so that we don't have to worry about having Node installed on our system. It will come bundled with everything it needs to start up the webserver itself.</p>
                    <p>But most importantly, the Appium GUI comes with the Inspector, which allows you to look through the element hierarchy of your app. This can help when you are writing your tests, so you know exactly what sequence of actions, on the correct elements, to perform on the app.</p>

                    <p>On a windows operating system, you're only going to be able to test android applications. iOS mobile development requires some technology that only runs on mac. But this won't prevent you running tests on iOS, remotely at least. Finding out what you're actually trying to test can be tricky if you can't see what youre look at though!</p>
                    <p>So we need a lot of technology here! we should be able to find all of these programs, frameworks and libraries on our environment, either as its own program, or bundled in with Eclipse.</p>
                    <p>You should also install git if you are planning on having version control for your script code. Another program you can install is cURL, if you are planning on using Sauce storage to host your application to test on sauce labs.</p>
                    <p>If you'd like to see the exact set-up steps, you can look in the documentation.</p>

                    <p>Recommend Mac OS X 10.10</p>
                    <p>Authorize: You need to authorize use of the iOS Simulator by running the authorize-ios binary made available through npm. If you installed globally, by running npm install -g appium, use
                      <pre style="display:inline;">sudo authorize-ios</pre>
                      If you installed locally, the binary will be installed within the node_modules/.bin directory, so use <pre style="display:inline;">sudo node_modules/.bin/authorize-ios</pre>
                      # alternatively
                      <pre style="display:inline;">sudo $(npm bin)/authorize-ios</pre>
                      If you are running Appium.app, you can authorize iOS through the GUI. You need to do this every time you install a new version of Xcode.</p>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>As was mentioned a little earlier, the Appium GUI is a wrapper around the aapium node.js server. It bundles up all of the assets that you need for the appium webserver, as well as provides you with an inspector. The inspector is the core part of the GUI, as it enables you to examine the elements and hierarchy of elements in your application, which helps when writing Appium test scripts.</p>

				  <h3>How Appium WebDriver Works</h3>
                  <p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Write script</li>
                      <li>Run script - Sends commands to Appium Webserver via Appium Client library</li>
                      <li>Appium Server sends commands to mobile simulator/emulator</li>
                      <li>Appium Server sends results back</li>
                      <li>(On Sauce Labs) Test Assets are created</li>
                    </ol>
                  </p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>So first, we need to actually write our test script. When we go to run it, the Appium Client library that we used to will connect and send the commands to the local or remote appium webserver. Our script and the commands we write in it all talk to the REST API on the Appium server, via HTTP requests.</p>
                    <p>The webserver then sends those commands to the device, and then collects and sends the results back via and HTTP response.</p>
                    <p>Our script then takes those results, and it's up to us to pass those results onto Sauce Labs, or deal with them locally.</p>
                    <p>If we run this test using sauce labs, then one more additional step will be done, which is to create the test records, so the video recoridng, screenshots, and logs.</p>

capabilities.setCapability("app", "/path/to/app/ContactManager.apk");

                    <aside class="notes">
                      <p>So for those of you who may have done local Selenium testing, these Desired Capabilities may look unfamiliar. One key difference between selenium and Appium is that Appium requires an Appium webserver, even for local tests. So we need to set these desired capabilties so the client can tell the server what settings we want to test with.</p>
                      <p>In our case, we are going to be testing on this Nexus device, and we're going to load up our app, Contactmanager.apk onto that device and run our test on it.</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                      <p>Tests might fail because the elements that are expected for the next step haven't loaded in the app yet. It's good to have an explicit wait time in this case as it can be variable how long it takes for an element to be loaded, especially if an action takes us to a new screen in th app.</p>
                      <p>For example, when we click on that drop-down that has an ID of ham, it takes time for the options on the drop down to render. We would need to set a wait in order for the action on the drop down to succeed.</p>
                      <p>While we may not have waits in our current script, we will take a look at them in a later module.</p>

                        For iOS the IDs are a little complicated. Appium will first search for an accessibility id that matches. If there is none found, a string match will be attempted on the element labels. Finally, if the id passed in is a localization key, it will search the localized string. For Android, the id is the element’s android:id.</p>

                    <p>Technically, all Appium scripts call out to a server. So you can think of them as all being remote, even if you are hosting the server on your own local machine. But if your script is going to talk to Sauce Labs, then it needs a couple of other additional items to be setup. First, we'll need to edit the "app" desired cap to point to where the application is hosted which can pretty uch be anywhere. You can host it on a digitalocean or aws webserver, you can host it locally and then use Sacue Connect, or you can upload it to Sauce storage. Second, we'll need to authenticate with Sauce Labs. And lastly, we'll need to set additional desired capabilities, which defines what device and OS combination we will use, as well as the version of the OS and appium itself.</p>

                    There are many situations in which your test script may run ahead of the website or application you're testing, resulting in timeouts and a failing test. For example, you may have a dynamic content element that, after a user clicks on it, a loading appears for five seconds. If your script isn't written in such a way as to account for that five second load time, it may fail because the next interactive element isn't available yet. The general recommended solution for this is to use explicit waits.

                  <h3>What is a Testing Framework?</h3>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>A test automation framework is a scaffold comprised of libraries, dependecies, drivers, and helper scripts that facilitate the execution of Appium test scripts.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Parallelization</li>
                    <li>Assertions</li>
                    <li>Reporting</li>
                  </ul>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Ok so what does that mean? It's essentially just a bunch of additional libraries we can use in conjunction with our script for several cases:</p>
                    <li>Record your data - Frameworks often have, or can have a way for you to output the results of your test scripts for you, rather than writing them by hand</li>
                    <li>Talk to external applications - you can include external libraries in your framework to talk to and send results to places like Sauce Labs</li>
                    <li>Parallelization - facilitates the running of your script on several different platform configurations at the same time, saving you time overall.</li>

                  <h3>Test Driven Development vs. Behavior Driven Development</h3>
                  <p>TDD: A developer writes the test, and then writes code, and tests that code continuously, until the test passes.</p>
                  <p>BDD: A way to plan and develop code similar to TDD, but allows teams to include non-technical members when writing tests for scenarios and features</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>In the QA/Test industry, there are a couple of different ways of thinking about how to develop applications with testing in mind. One of those is TDD, where you write a test, and then write the code until the test passes. Antoher variant is to plan the same kind of testing, but on a higher level, basically written in a more colloquial manner though.</p>
                    <p>TDD is also somewhat synonymous with "test first" development. BDD means writing tests that read like a book, almost in full sentences, so people can understand precisely what a test is trying to accomplish.</p>

                  <h3>TDD Planning Example</h3>
                  <p>Sauce_counter() needs to count the number of sauces inputted</p>
                  <p>Pasta_counter() needs to count the number of pastas inputted</p>
                  <p>sNpComparer() needs to compare the counts and make sure that they are equal</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is an example of TDD, because we have idenfitfied features of the program that need to be made, and we have a function for each one, which details very explicity what each will do.</p>

                  <p>Then my chef will be happy</p></ul>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is an example of BDD, which uses the Given, When, Then, method of planning. It details the actual goals of what the application or feature needs to accomplishes, in terms of a user story, rather than explicit functions. In this method of planning, we are making sure that the end goal or the business objective will be accomplished.</p>

                      <li>Open the assert script in your preferred text editor.</li>
                      <li>Add an assert that makes sure that the title of the guinea pig page is "I am a page title - Sauce Labs".</li>
                      <li>Add an assert that makes sure that the checkbox is checked (true).</li>
                      <li>Run the script.</li>

                  <h3>Record your Results with Sauce Labs</h3>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Use the update_job method in the Sauce Labs REST API after the test has run.</li>
                  <p></p>
                  <li>Use the Java Helper library; it will automatically send pass/fail results to Sauce Labs</li>
                  <p></p>
                  <li>Configure your testing framework to send results to Sauce Labs</li>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>So locally it's not an issue to record results, you can just print results to a file or on the console. But if we want to send details to Sauce Labs on whether a test has passed or failed, rather than just complete or not, we will have to use the Sauce Labs API or a test framework.

                     <div style="padding-top:10px;"><p><strong>Small:</strong> Tests should be short and succinct.</p>
                     <p><strong>Atomic:</strong> Tests should focus on testing a single feature.</p>
                     <p><strong>Autonomous:</strong> Tests should be independent of other tests.</p>

                     <aside class="notes">

                       <p>Short - If you have a test suite of 100 tests running concurrently on 100 VMs, then the time it will take to run the entire suite will be determined by the longest/slowest test case. Keeping your tests small ensures that your suite will run efficiently and provide you with results faster. </p>
                       <p>Atomic - The test makes clear exactly what it is that you're testing. If the test fails, then you should also have a very clear idea of what needs to be fixed. </p>
                       <p>Autonomous - Tests should not be dependent on the results of one test to run successfully. In addition, an autonomous test should use its own data to test against, and not create potential conflicts with other tests over the same data.  </p>

                       <p>Performance testing serves to answer questions such as, can your application server handle a particular load, and does it behave as expected when you push it to its limit? These types of tests are better undertaken with a testing infrastructure that has been specifically developed for performance testing, so all baseline performance metrics are well established and understood before you start the test.</p>

                    <p>Setup initiates <i>prerequisite</i> tasks to be taken care of before your test runs, usually setting the capabilities, configuring additional browser parameters, and more.</p>

                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <pre><code class="java" data-trim contenteditable>

                     <ul>
                       <li>Code reuse across tests; reuse common element interactions</li>

                     </ul>
                     <aside class="notes">
                       <p>
                         Sometimes we interact with particular elements in our application repeatedly. The nature of applications is that they change over time as well. Instead of writing the same code for the same interacctions, we can add a level of abstraction with page objects.

                     <aside class="notes">
                       <p>So in this example here, we are abtracting the locating, of the textbox, and the insertion of text into it. We're making the locating and sending it inputs all in one go, all in one object.</p>

                     <h3>Parallelization</h3>
                     <p>Avoid dependencies between tests</p>
                     <ul><li>If you chain tests together, when one at the top fails, then they will all fail.</li></ul>
                     <p>Use Frameworks</p>
                     <ul><li>Frameworks include helpful libraries and functionality that can help you make the most of parallelization.</li></ul>
                     <aside class="notes">
                       <p>Running tests in parallel is the secret Sauce for accelerating your development process and creating a continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline.</p>
                       <p>One of the main features that Sauce Labs offers is parallelization, the ability to run serveral scripts at once on a variety of platforms. Since tests and commands are sent remotely, these tests take longer to run individually, but with parallelization, we can run them all at once. That is, we can start them all at the same time, which cuts down on the total time tests would normally take, saving time and money for your teams and business.</p>
                       <p>It's good to avoid dependencies between tests. This goes along with the atomic testing strategy, where we want to create autonomous tests, so that they don't depend on each other, and when one fails, then we know exactly what failed.</p>
